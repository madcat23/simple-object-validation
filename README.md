#### Easy to use. Easy to extend.
simple-object-validation is a lightweight validation library that provides an easy and functional way of validating javascript objects in your web forms. It is made to work well with Redux Form but you can really use it anywhere.

It is still in beta stadium but you can already have a look at the core functions and some validator implementations.
#### More and more validators will be added soon...
